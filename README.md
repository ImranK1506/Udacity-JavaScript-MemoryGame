## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Get started

* git clone: https://github.com/ImranK1506/Udacity-JavaScript-MemoryGame
* open the source code in your editor
* open the index.html in your favorite browser to get a glimpse

## Content

`startGame() {}` - shuffles the deck and loops through the array of cards

`endGame() {}` - ends the game where the timer stops and displays a modal with the end result

`resetGame() {}` - resets the game to it's default value

`replayGame() {}` - closes the modal and starts a new session
